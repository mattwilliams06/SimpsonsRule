# Simpson's Rule

The module simpson.py contains a class and methods for performing the numerical integration method Simpson's Rule. The first, second, and third rules are all included as methods. Where applicable, uneven spacing of stations/intervals is allowed. 

Although Simpson's rule is a general method that applies to a wide variety of applications, this implementation is targeting Naval Architecture and ship design. As such, attributes such as longitudinal center of floatation will be computed and accessible.
